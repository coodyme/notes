- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS can be used with any JavaScript framework or even without any framework. It is framework-agnostic and integrates well with different front-end frameworks and libraries.

- Styled Components: Styled Components is primarily used with React. It is tightly integrated with the React ecosystem and provides specific APIs and features designed for React component styling.

Ultimately, the choice between Tailwind CSS and Styled Components depends on your preferred styling approach, the level of customization needed, the framework you are using, and your development workflow.
