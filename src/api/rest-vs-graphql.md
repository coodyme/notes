- Provides a more efficient and flexible approach to fetching and manipulating data from APIs compared to traditional RESTful APIs

- Instead of relying on fixed endpoints and predefined response like in REST, clients can send requests to a single endpoint and specify exactly what data they need.

- Allows client to retrieve multiple resources in a single request, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
