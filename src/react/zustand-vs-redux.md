## Redux

- Too much boilerplate code
- Complicated for beginners
- Write too much code to do small UI changes
- Only for medium to large sized projects

## Zustand

- Straight to the point
- Simplified to get started with advanced options
- Write only the code needed to manage the state
- All sorts of projects
- Define your own folder structure and how to handle multiple stores

## Zustand Middleware

Another awesome feature of Zustand is the ability to create middleware to add additional features to your store. For example, you can easily create middleware to log state changes.
