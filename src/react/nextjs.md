## What is Next.js

Next.js is a popular open-source framework for building web applications with React. It is based on JavaScript and provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to develop robust and performant web applications.

Next.js offers server-side rendering (SSR), which means that the web pages are rendered on the server and sent to the client as HTML. This can result in faster initial page loads and better search engine optimization (SEO).

One of the key features of Next.js is its support for static site generation (SSG). This allows developers to pre-render static HTML pages at build time, which can be served to the client without the need for a server. It can greatly improve the performance and scalability of websites.

Next.js also provides client-side rendering (CSR) capabilities, allowing parts of the application to be rendered on the client side using JavaScript. This can be useful for dynamic content that needs to be updated frequently without a full page reload.

Additionally, Next.js has built-in routing, code splitting, and support for serverless functions, making it a versatile framework for building modern web applications. It also has a strong ecosystem and is widely adopted in the React community.

Overall, Next.js simplifies the process of building powerful and optimized web applications by providing a comprehensive set of tools and features that streamline development and enhance performance.
