Imagine you have a big house with many rooms. Each room represents a different page or view of your web application. React router is like a smart guide that helps you navigate through these rooms easily.

- Allows you to create different "routes" for your web pages
- Routes are like paths to specific rooms in your house
- It is a library for React
- When you click on a link or type a specific URL, React Router will know which page you want to go and take you there without reloading the entire web app
