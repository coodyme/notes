## The call stack

> JavaScript is **single-threaded** that means `one thread == one call stack == one thing at a time`

The call stack is part of the JavaScript engine, this isn't browser specific. The principle of the stack it's **Last-In-First-Out** (LIFO). 

In JavaScript when a function get **pushed to** the call stack when they're **invoked** and **popped off** when they **return a value**

That means the most recently executed function is the first one to be removed from the stack.

- Event loop has one very simple job: look at the stack and look at the task queue. If the stack is empty it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it on to the stack
