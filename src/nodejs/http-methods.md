## Difference between PUT and PATCH request

PUT is a method of modifying resources where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. PUT is similar to POST in that it can create resources, but it does so when there is a defined URL wherein PUT replaces the entire resource if it exists or creates new if it does not exist.

Unlike PUT Request, PATCH does partial update e.g. Fields that need to be updated by the client, only that field is updated without modifying the other field.
