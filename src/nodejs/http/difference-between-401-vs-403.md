HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) are both related to access control and authentication, but they have distinct meanings and use cases. Here are some examples to illustrate when each status code should be used:

	1.	401 (Unauthorized):
	•	Scenario: A user attempts to access a resource that requires authentication.
	•	Example: When a user tries to access a protected API endpoint without providing valid credentials or without being authenticated.
	•	Response: The server should respond with a 401 status code to indicate that the user is not authorized to access the resource. Additionally, the response may include a WWW-Authenticate header to prompt the client for valid credentials.
	2.	403 (Forbidden):
	•	Scenario: A user is authenticated, but they lack the necessary permissions to access a resource.
	•	Example: A user with standard user privileges tries to access an administrative panel or a restricted section of a website.
	•	Response: The server should respond with a 403 status code to indicate that the user is authenticated but does not have sufficient permissions to access the requested resource. The server may include an error message in the response body to provide further details.

In summary, use 401 (Unauthorized) when the user is not authenticated or has not provided valid credentials, and use 403 (Forbidden) when the user is authenticated but lacks the necessary permissions to access a resource. These status codes help provide meaningful feedback to clients and guide them in making appropriate requests or taking corrective actions.
