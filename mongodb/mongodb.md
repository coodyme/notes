## MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular open-source database system that falls under the category of NoSQL databases. In simple words, MongoDB is a type of database that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format called BSON (Binary JSON).

## What are NoSQL databases? What are the different types of NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases (like SQL, Oracle, etc.).

Types of NoSQL databases:

- Document Oriented
- Key Value
- Graph
- Column Oriented

## Which are the most important features of MongoDB

- Flexible data model in form of documents
- Agile and highly scalable database
- Faster than traditional databases
- Expressive query language

## How is MongoDB better than other SQL databases?

MongoDB allows a highly flexible and scalable document structure. For e.g. one data document in MongoDB can have five columns and the other one in the same collection can have ten columns. Also, MongoDB database are faster as compared to SQL databases due to efficient indexing and storage techniques.

## Does MongoDB need a lot of RAM?

No. MongoDB can be run even on a small amount of RAM. MongoDB dynamically allocates and de-allocates RAM based on the requirements of other processes.
